## Why Temporal?

### Challenges of Maintaining State in Distributed Systems

- Consistency
- Fault Tolerance
- Scalability
- Concurrency Control
- Security

**Temporal** is introduced here as a proposal of Workflow Orchestration for managing long-running operations **(durable execution)**, humans in the loop and system lifecycle **(state management, guaranteed completion with compensations and uniqueness)**. 
You can use **Temporal** today for implementing sequence actions in certain order for any business logic, not only for communication between services **(Microservices Orchestration)** but also for **Monolith** apps. 
**Workflows** can react to async and external events **(signals, updates)**, aggregating data and then doing some actions with exponential retries **(activities)** and run for extended periods (heartbeat), then you can check the state of these executions at any time **(queries)**. Also we can have periodic executions for business logic with time based and delays **(scheduling)**.

### Use Cases

â€¢	**Order Processing Systems:** Managing the lifecycle of orders from placement to fulfillment, including inventory checks, payment processing, and shipping.
â€¢	**User Onboarding:** Coordinating steps involved in onboarding new users, such as account creation, email verification, and initial setup tasks.
â€¢	**Data Pipelines:** Orchestrating data ingestion, transformation, and storage processes with reliability and scalability.
â€¢	**Batch Processing:** Handling large-scale batch jobs with retry mechanisms and progress monitoring.
