> **ProjectX** is a comprehensive full-stack template designed to simplify the development of scalable and resilient applications using **React** and **Temporal**. By integrating Temporal's advanced workflow orchestration with React's dynamic frontend framework, ProjectX enables developers to build applications with durable executions and seamless communication between services.

## Why Temporal? 🤔

### Challenges of Maintaining State in Distributed Systems

- Consistency
- Fault Tolerance
- Scalability
- Concurrency Control
- Security

**Temporal** is introduced here as a **Workflow Orchestration** tool for managing long-running operations **(durable execution)**, humans in the loop and system lifecycle **(state management, guaranteed completion with compensations and uniqueness)**. 
You can use **Temporal** today for implementing a sequence of steps/actions in certain order for your business processes **(workflows)**, 
not only for communication between services **(Microservices Orchestration)** but also for **Monolith** apps. 
**Workflows** can react to async and external events **(signals, updates)**, aggregating data and then doing some actions **(activities)** with exponential retries **(retry policy)** and run for extended periods **(heartbeat)** if needed, then you can check the state of these executions at any time **(queries)**.
Additionally, workflows support scheduled and time-based executions with configurable delays for recurring business logic **(scheduling)**.

### Use Cases

•	**Order Processing Systems:** Managing the lifecycle of orders from placement to fulfillment, including inventory checks, payment processing, and shipping.

•	**User Onboarding:** Coordinating steps involved in onboarding new users, such as account creation, email verification, and initial setup tasks.

•	**Data Pipelines:** Orchestrating data ingestion, transformation, and storage processes with reliability and scalability.

•	**Batch Processing:** Handling large-scale batch jobs with retry mechanisms and progress monitoring.
