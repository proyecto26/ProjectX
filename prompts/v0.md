- Think carefully about the component and follow the bellow Guide before Creating the prompt to build the component in the Project:
  - Review components in the `libs/frontend/ui/src/lib` directory, and create directories if needed for grouping similar components (e.g. `navigation`, `icons`, `layouts`, etc).
  - Use TypeScript with JSX for all component files (`.tsx` extension).
  - Use Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling. Utilize utility classes directly in the JSX.
  - For complex styles, consider using the `classnames` function from `libs/frontend/ui/src/utils/tailwind.ts` to conditionally apply classes (already uses `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` internally).
  - Ensure responsiveness by using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`), start using DaisyUI's responsive classes before adding new ones if needed.
  - Define prop types using TypeScript interfaces.
  - Use default props where appropriate. Example:
    ```typescript
    interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
      variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'accent' | 'ghost';
    }

    export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
      children, 
      variant = 'primary', 
      className = '', 
      ...props 
    }) => {
      // Component logic here
    };
    ```
  - Use Framer Motion for animations to ensure smooth, consistent animations across the app.
  - Ensure all components are accessible. Use semantic HTML elements.
  - Include proper ARIA attributes where necessary.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly.
  - Use `usehooks-ts` if needed for UI logic (follow the DRY principle), but prefer custom hooks over `usehooks-ts` for business logic.
  - For more complex state management, consider using React Context with a Provider and Consumer pattern, or Zustand if needed.
  - Use `remix-utils` for Remix routing logic and SSR/Backend logic.
  - Use TypeScript types, props and JSDoc comments (when needed) to describe the component's purpose and props.
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders by using callbacks and memoization techniques.
  - Support both light and dark themes using Tailwind and DaisyUI dark mode classes.
  - Use popular PostCSS plugins like `postcss-import`, `tailwindcss`, `tailwindcss/nesting` and `autoprefixer` to ensure compatibility with Tailwind CSS and cross-browser compatibility.
  - Use popular TailwindCSS plugins like `@tailwindcss/typography`, `@tailwindcss/forms`, `@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio`, `@tailwindcss/line-clamp`, `@headlessui/tailwindcss`, `@shrutibalasa/tailwind-grid-auto-fit`, etc to enhance the component's functionality and styling.
  - Use popular npm packages like `@heroicons/react`, `@headlessui/react`, `axios`, `lodash`, `react-responsive`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `use-places-autocomplete`, `swiper`, `react-toastify`, `inputmask`, `@pixi/react`, `date-fns`, `react-cookie`, etc to enhance UX and business logic.
- Summarize the previous guide and Generate a prompt for the component with a maxium length of 10000 characters.
- Then with the prompt create a clickable link: [component name](https://v0.dev/chat?q={prompt})
- Make sure prompt is url encoded
